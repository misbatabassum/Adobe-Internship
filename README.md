### Noto Emoji SVG Project

**Background**
OpenType-SVG is a font format that has some or all glyphs represented as SVG (scalable vector graphics) artwork. SVG is a text-based graphics language that describes images with vector shapes, text, and embedded raster graphics. The ability to style SVG with CSS and the support of scripting and animation makes SVG an integral part of the web platform. By allowing glyphs to be represented as SVG artwork, glyphs can be displayed in multiple colors and gradients. 

**Project Objective**
Currently, some browsers like Firefox and Chrome do not support OpenType-SVG fonts. The purpose of this project is to encourage browsers to support OpenType-SVG fonts in addition to adding support for Unicode 13.1. 

**Outcome**
The final release of NotoEmoji-SVG is uploaded on Github, and supported in Adobe's major applications like InDesign, Photoshop, and Illustrator.
